A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

## Project Overview -

This proposed system comprises key components of Augmented Reality, real-time chat and time-management and scheduling calendar interfaces.Through this project we are proposing the idea of an AR based scanner which will recognize the unique code/faces of the faculty members and officials and after scanning the app will show all the details in Augmented Reality. It will also show the schedule of that person that will give an idea to the student when that person is free to take calls or chats, and will help fix an appointment to get their problems answered thus making the inefficient system efficient.

## Proposed System - 

We aim to create an AR Based Social platform where users have to register themselves and the app will generate a unique code as well as the app will also create image objects from their pictures in the backend. Scanner will have the responsive feature that will get adjusted with the unique code or the pictures. Through this app people are able to scan each other's unique codes and get the details like, name, address, email, phone number, social media accounts, schedules, etc. in Augmented Reality. App will have the feature of Real Time chat, calls as well as integrated payment system.  People are only able to chat or call with only those people who have made connections with each other. Connections are automatically made after scanning each other's unique code. Students will be able to confirm the appointment time with the teacher according to their schedule. Users will have a feedback portal to raise any issue or report any irregularities or any type of bug. If a user completes 100 scans, they will get an opportunity to get the rewards. 

## The following are the features of the proposed system:
●	Feedback Portal
●	Leaderboard 
●	Connections list
●	Unlimited scans
●	Rewards Panel
●	Profile section to view the details of the user
●	A feature to avoid the duplication of the fake profiles
●	In-App Augmented Reality imaging of the person 


## Objectives - 

The proposed research is aimed to carry out work leading to the development of an approach for AR Based Social Platform. The proposed aim will be achieved by dividing the work into following objectives:

●	Converting Information into scannable Unique Code.
●	Making People Picture an image object.
●	P2P Real-Time chat.
●	Effective and rapid recognition of persons' pictures.
●	Peer auto-update schedule with automated appointment scheduling.
